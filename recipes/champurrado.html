                <li>2 ounces piloncillo, <i>plus more to taste</i></li>
                <li>2 (3-ounce) discs Abuelita brand Mexican chocolate</li>
                <li>1 cinnamon stick</li>
                <li>1 1/2 cups warm water</li>
                <li>1/2 cup masa harina</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
                <li>1 pinch salt</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Add milk, piloncillo, Mexican chocolate, and cinnamon stick to a medium 
                    saucepan or pot. Heat over low-medium heat until the piloncillo and 
                    chocolate have completely dissolved. Stir frequently to make sure nothing 
                    sticks to the bottom of the saucepan.
                </li>
                <li>Remove and discard the cinnamon stick, using a strainer if it has broken 
                    into pieces.
                </li>
                <li>In a small bowl, add warm water and masa harina. Whisk together until the 
                    mixture is smooth.
                </li>
                <li>Add the masa harina mixture, vanilla extract, and salt to the saucepan. 
                    Whisk to combine.
                </li>
                <li>Bring to a simmer, reduce heat to low, and continue to cook, whisking 
                    frequently, for 25-30 minutes until thick, creamy, velvety, and smooth. 
                    The champurrado should be thick enough to coat the back of a spoon.
                </li>
                <li>Serve and garnish with a touch of ground cinnamon or a cinnamon 
                    stick.
                </li>
            </ol>
        <h2>Tips</h2>
            <ul>
                <li> Using whole milk is best since it provides a thicker and creamier texture 
                    and flavor, but you can use 2% if you prefer. You can also use almond milk 
                    to make it dairy free.
                </li>
                <li>Do not have piloncillo? You can use 2 tablespoons of dark brown sugar instead.
                    It will achieve the same.
                </li>
                <li>Make sure to whisk vigorously throughout the whole process to help get the drink 
                    as smooth and velvety smooth as possible. The champurrado should be completely smooth 
                    and not grainy. If it is still a little grainy, continue whisking until it becomes smooth.
                </li>
