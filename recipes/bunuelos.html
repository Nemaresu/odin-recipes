        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>To finish off this trilogy of Mexican holiday cuisine, we have bunuelos.
               A perfect treat to end on after a nice meal of tamales and champurrado. 
               This Mexican treat is simply fried dough covered in cinnamon. 
               Though simple on paper they do require a bit of work to make, but like 
               tamales are <i>well</i> worth the effort.   
            </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>3/4 cup warm water</li>
                <li>4 tablespoons oil, <i>plus 2 or more cups for frying</i></li>
                <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon ground cinnamon</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>At any point for the cinnamon sugar topping combine granulated sugar
                    and ground cinnamon in a small bowl. Set aside.
                </li>
                <li>Now for the the bunuelos add all-purpose flour, baking powder and salt 
                    in a large bowl. Mix together until combined. 
                </li>
                <li>Add warm water and 4 tablespoons oil. Mix together with a spoon or your 
                    hands until the dough comes together.
                </li>
                <li>Transfer the dough onto a clean working surface and knead the dough for 8 
                    to 10 minutes, until the dough is smooth and elastic.
                </li>
                <li>Roll the dough into a ball, place it in a bowl, cover with a kitchen towel 
                    and let it rest for 30 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>While the dough is resting, cover a large plate with paper towels, fill a large 
                    saute pan with 1 to 2 inches of frying oil and make the cinnamon sugar topping. 
                    Set aside.
                </li>
                <li>Divide the dough into 8 separate pieces and roll each piece into a ball. On a lightly 
                    floured surface, use a floured rolling pin to roll out each ball into an 8 to 10-inch circle. 
                    I recommend laying the rolled out dough onto a large kitchen towel in one single layer. 
                    Don't stack the rolled out dough on top of each other or it may stick.
                </li>
                <li>Heat the frying oil to 350°F. Fry each dough circle for about 60 seconds, turning once, until 
                    golden brown on both sides. Transfer to prepared plate to drain any excess oil. Sprinkle heavily 
                    with cinnamon sugar topping.
                </li>
             </ol>
        <h2>Tips</h2>   
            <ul>
                <li>Bunuelos can fluff up a lot when frying, creating huge air pockets that look cool but are not very 
                    conducive to eating. To minimize the very large air pockets, I recommend using metal tongs to 
                    keep the dough fully submerged in the oil for the first 10-15 seconds of frying. This will 
                    fry both of the sides at the same time, reducing the amount.
                </li>
                <li>Sprinkle the cinnamon sugar on the bunuelos as soon as possible to ensure that it “sticks” to 
                    the fried dough.
                </li>
                <li>To store, I recommend stacking them on a plate and covering them with a simple paper towel or 
                    napkin on the counter for up to 3 days. If you cover them completely with a air tight cloche 
                    or place them in the fridge, they can lose some of their crunchy and crispy texture. 
                    They'll still taste good though!
