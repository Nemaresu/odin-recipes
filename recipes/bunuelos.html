        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>To finish off this trilogy of Mexican holiday cuisine, we have bunuelos.
               A perfect treat to end on after a nice meal of tamales and champurrado. 
               This Mexican treat is simply fried dough covered in cinnamon. 
               Though simple on paper they do require a bit of work to make, but like 
               tamales are <i>well</i> worth the effort.
