                <li> 10 ounces lard or vegetable shortening</li>
                <li> 1 1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
                <li> 1 1/2 cups chicken stock or vegetable stock</li>

                <li> 32 dried corn husks</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Pat the pork dry and rub it all over with olive oil. Combine 4 tablespoons of salt
                     with the chipotle pepper and rub all over the pork. Let rest at room temperature 
                     for 1 hour.
                </li>
                <li>Heat the oven to 275Â°F. Place the pork in a roasting pan, cover with two layers
                     of foil, and roast until tender and falling apart. Let the pork cool for 30 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>Shred the pork into strands. Discard any gristle and strain and reserve the cooking 
                    liquid.
                </li>
                <li>Toast the chiles in a hot skillet for about 30 seconds per side. Place in a bowl, 
                    cover with hot water, and let them soak for 30 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>Blend the soaked chiles, garlic, cumin, 1 teaspoon of salt, and cold water until 
                    smooth. Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large pot until very hot. Add the chile 
                    puree and cook until it darkens.
                </li>
                <li>Stir the pork and cooking liquid into the pot. Simmer for 15 minutes. Let cool
                     slightly before assembling the tamales.
                </li>
                <li>Make the tamale dough. Mix together the masa, water, then add in the lard, baking 
                    powder, stock, and salt and mix well to combine.
                </li>
                <li>Cover the corn husks with water. Soak until pliable, then remove from the water, 
                    separate the husks, and pat dry. Tear a few husks into 1/2-inch strips and tie a 
                    knot at the end to create ties for the tamales.
                </li>
                <li>Fill the tamales. Working with one husk at a time, spread 1/4 cup of the masa 
                    harina over the smooth side of the husk, leaving a 1/2-inch border. Top with 2 
                    tablespoons of the pork, then roll the tamale and secure the bottom with one of 
                    the ties, leaving the top open.
                </li>
                <li>Prepare a steamer in a large stockpot partially filled with water. Stand the 
                    tamales upright in the steamer and cook until the masa pulls away from the husks, 
                    adding water as needed. Let the tamales rest in the steamer until they begin to 
                    firm up before serving.
                </li>
            </ol>    
         <h2>Tips</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Extra pulled pork filling can be used in tacos, sandwiches, enchiladas, or as a 
                    topping for a rice bowl.
                </li>
                <li>When filling your tamales, make sure you spread the filling on the smooth side of 
                    the husk. This will allow the filling to release easily from the corn husk.
                </li>
                <li>Store leftover tamales in a sealed container or resealable bag in the refrigerator 
                    for up to 3 days. Gently reheat in a steamer.
